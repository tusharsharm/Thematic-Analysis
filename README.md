## Thematic Analysis with Subjective Logic using ML and NLP
This project combines thematic analysis with machine learning (ML) and advanced NLP techniques to understand user beliefs, disbeliefs, and uncertainties around Ayushman Bharat scheme-related queries. It integrates subjective logic, deep learning models, and thematic coding to extract meaningful insights from synthetic survey data.

##  Objectives
- Apply thematic analysis on public health-related opinions.

- Incorporate subjective logic (belief, disbelief, uncertainty) for nuanced interpretation.

- Compare ML (Random Forest) and DL (BERT, Word2Vec, etc.) approaches.

- Generate synthetic labeled data using 15 seed questions.

- Use visual tools like PR curves, confusion matrix, and feature importance for evaluation.
  

üîç Key Components
üß† Thematic Analysis Pipeline
- Familiarization with text data.

- Code and generate initial themes from synthetic responses.

- Review and refine themes using ML support.

- Final thematic structure exported and visualized.

üßÆ Subjective Logic Modeling
- Prediction of belief, disbelief, and uncertainty.

- Feature extraction using BERT, Word2Vec, and TF-IDF.

- Random Forest classifier and hyperparameter tuning.

- Evaluation using accuracy, F1, and visualization tools.

ü§ñ Deep Learning Integration
- Sentence embeddings using pre-trained BERT.

- Fine-tuned models for better performance on belief prediction.

- Comparative performance analysis between traditional ML and DL.

üìà Visualizations
- Confusion Matrix

- Precision-Recall Curve

- Feature Importance

- Theme Clusters (Optional: PCA/TSNE)
